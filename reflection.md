- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
It seems overly complicated. I've done a similar project to this in Python and all the technicalities that came up while writing this Java program were frustrating to deal with as my code fluctuated very often.
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
I think that knowing the basics of programming in any language gives you some idea of what you need to to to acomplish something in another language but the difficult part is figuring out the syntax and all the other differences and intricacies.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I found ways to choose and random canned response and how to replace the correct words with the mirrored ones but I didn't have time to get to the transcript.
